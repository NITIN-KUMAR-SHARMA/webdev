# Exercise 8

## Load movies from database on initial render

We've been reading directly from the `/server/db.json` file, which doesn't seem realistic. Let's now actually make a request to the server for the initial payload of movies when the app renders the first time.

Delete the `import db from 'server/db.json'` statement and the part where you read `movies` from the `db` import.

Next, let's add a `useEffect` hook to make a GET request to `http://localhost:3001/movies` and get those movies. Once the request comes back, update the current state with them.

Make sure you have the `useEffect` hook only run once, otherwise you'll create an infinite loop.

Now that you're loading from the server, you won't start off initially with a featured movie. Your app will probably crash until you conditionally render the `FeaturedMovie` section.

## Identify the UI bug

<hr>

Let's simulate make your local server a little more realistic to reveal the visual bug with your app right now... Instead of running your server with `$ yarn db`, run it with: 

```
$ yarn db-slow
```

Reload your page, and notice your very beautiful app with blank sections of the screen, because no data has loaded yet. Latency issues are a common source of bugs with UI and business logic. They're easy to miss when you're working locally, because requests are basically instantaneous over localhost.

This looks like a job for some loading messages! There are so many ways to indicate a loading state. If you're feeling adventurous, use [one of the many libraries out there](https://reactjsexample.com/tag/loading/). Otherwise, we can start with a simple "Loading..." text.

## Add a loading message

Let's say you have a component `ShowFoo` that should render `Foo` when we're not loading. There are many patterns for showing a loading message. Can you think of three?

1. Control it outside the component and only render `ShowFoo` when we're not loading:

    ```js
    {loading ? (
      <p>Loading...</p>
    ) : (
      <ShowFoo />
    )}
    ```

1. Control it inside the `ShowFoo` component and give it a `loading` prop:

    ```js
    <ShowFoo loading={loading} />
    
    // inside ShowFoo...
    if (loading) return (<p>Loading...</p>)
    return (<Foo />)
    ```

1. Create a `Loadable` component and pass `ShowFoo` as a child. The `Loadable` component has the render logic to either show a message or the `children` passed in.

    ```js
    <Loadable loading={loading}>
      <ShowFoo />
    </Loadable>
    ```

What would be some pros/cons of each approach? ðŸ¤”

## Challenges

### Auto-preview the movie poster for add/edit

Product comes back saying the [Preview] button for the movie poster is annoying to users. They want the image to load magically for them once they're done typing.

Add a `useEffect` to track changes to the URL input, and update the `src` of the preview `img` accordingly.

**Bonus challenge**: Right now, as the user is typing, there's a *bunch* of bad image URLs being tried out. See if you can [debounce](https://redd.one/blog/debounce-vs-throttle) the logic so it only loads the image after there's a pause in the user's typing. Debounce won't work the way you might think with `useEffect`, so check out [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61786423/2672869) for a deep-dive.
