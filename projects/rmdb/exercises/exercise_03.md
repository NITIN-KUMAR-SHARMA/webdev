# Exercise 3

## Extract `MovieListSection`

Create a component called `MovieListSection` which takes `movies` and a `title` as props, and displays the title and lists out the movies.

> **ðŸ¤” Stop and think**
> 
> At this point, the `Watchlist` and `AllMovies` components don't really do much. Are they worth keeping around?
> 
> Depends on what you think are the requirements. Maybe they will start to differ in the future, although maybe not.
> 
> It can also be nice to keep the high-level view of the App pretty abstracted:
> 
> ```
> <App>
>   <NavBar />
>   <FeaturedMovie />
>   <Watchlist />
>   <AllMovies />
> </App>
> ```

## Add filters for TV or movies

Right now, we're mixing TV series and movies together. Product comes back and says they want filters for each display of movies. 

Let's give some control to the user, and let them choose to display any of the following:

1. Only TV series (those with `type: 'series'`)
1. Only movies (those with `type: 'movie'`)
1. Both TV series and movies (any type)

There's many different UIs to provide such control. For now, we're going to create three separate buttons, to let the user switch to that type of display. Something like this:

You should be adding this code to the `MovieListSection` component.

There are *many ways* to solve this challenge. Here's one way.

- Track a piece of state, `filterType`, which will could be `null`, `'movie'`, or `'series'`
- When it's `null`, use all movies, otherwise filter the movies down with `Array#filter`
- You could do something like this:

```js
const filteredMovies = filterType === 'all' ? movies : movies.filter(m => m.type === filterType)
```

## Do not show filter options for Watchlist

You were pretty excited because it looks like the Watchlist section got those filters for free! React component reuse for the win!

Then product comes back to you and says, "We don't want to show those filters for the Watchlist section."

[Well, darn](https://media.giphy.com/media/mWMML2LQBsj8k/giphy.gif).

Without changing your component structure, think about how to *not* show filters for the Watchlist but *do* show filters for All Movies.

- Remember you can use conditional rendering, based off props
- Try passing in a prop to `MovieListSection` like `filterable`, and only display the filters when that prop is set to `true`
