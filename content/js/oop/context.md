## Scope and Context

### Adding Context to a Scope

- We already discussed **scope**
  -   Determines visibility of variables
  -   Lexical scope (location in source code)

- There is also **context**
  -   Refers to the location a function was invoked
  -   Dynamic, defined at runtime
  -   Context is accessible as the `this` variable

### Calling Functions Through Objects ### {#example-this}

~~~ {.javascript insert="../../../src/examples/js/this.js" token="manual"}

### Context and the `this` Keyword

- The `this` keyword is a reference to "the object of invocation"

- Bound at invocation (depends on the call site)

- Allows a method to reference the "current" object

- A single function can then service multiple objects

- Central to prototypical inheritance in JavaScript

### How JavaScript Sets the `this` Variable

- Resides in the global binding

- Inner functions do not capture parent's `this` (there are several
  workarounds such as `let self = this;`, `bind`, and ES2015 arrow
  functions)

- The `this` object can be set manually! (Take a look at the `call`,
  `apply`, and `bind` functions.)
